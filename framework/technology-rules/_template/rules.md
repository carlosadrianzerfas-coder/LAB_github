## Phase 01 — Proposal ({{technology_name}}-specific)

_Define any technology-specific constraints that must appear in the proposal:_
- Minimum Salesforce/platform version required
- Licensing constraints
- Known platform limitations to document upfront

---

## Phase 02 — Specs ({{technology_name}}-specific)

_Define acceptance criteria format or any spec requirements specific to this technology:_
- Required non-functional requirements (e.g., API rate limits, governor limits)
- Platform-specific security requirements
- Integration constraints

---

## Phase 03 — Design ({{technology_name}}-specific)

_Define architecture and design standards:_
- Preferred architectural patterns for this technology
- Naming convention references (link to `NamingConventions.md` if applicable)
- Component model / module structure standards
- Forbidden patterns (anti-patterns to avoid)

---

## Phase 04 — Tasks ({{technology_name}}-specific)

_Define how tasks should be decomposed for this technology:_
- Maximum granularity of a single task (e.g., one class, one component)
- Required task metadata (e.g., target org, deploy unit)
- Dependency constraints

---

## Phase 05 — Construction ({{technology_name}}-specific)

_Define build standards:_
- Required linting tools and configuration
- Code style guide reference
- Mandatory code review checklist items specific to this technology
- Deployment commands (exact CLI commands to use)
- Build failure protocol (what to do on partial deploy failure)

---

## Phase 06 — Verification ({{technology_name}}-specific)

_Define verification steps:_
- How to compare implementation against design in this technology
- Platform-specific verification tools (e.g., org diff, metadata comparison)
- Verification evidence format

---

## Phase 07 — Testing ({{technology_name}}-specific)

_Define testing standards:_
- Minimum test coverage threshold: **XX%**
- Test framework and runner commands
- Required test categories (unit, integration, e2e)
- Test data management approach
- Forbidden patterns in tests

---

## Phase 08 — Commit / PR ({{technology_name}}-specific)

_Define version control standards:_
- Branch naming convention
- Required PR checks (CI gates)
- Merge strategy (squash / merge commit / rebase)

---

## Phase 09 — Release ({{technology_name}}-specific)

_Define release / deployment standards:_
- Target environment progression (dev → staging → production)
- Release validation steps
- Post-deploy verification commands
- Rollback procedure

---

## Phase 10 — Archive ({{technology_name}}-specific)

_Define archiving standards:_
- What artifacts must be retained
- Where archived projects are stored
- Retention period

---

## Forbidden Patterns

_List of patterns that are NEVER allowed in this technology:_

```
❌ [Pattern 1] — Reason
❌ [Pattern 2] — Reason
```
