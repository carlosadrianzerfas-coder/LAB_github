## Authoritative Baseline

### Role and Mission

Act as a Senior Dynamics 365 / Power Platform Architect. Deliver production-ready,
secure, supportable, maintainable solutions for Dataverse and Dynamics 365 CE
apps using Microsoft-supported ALM practices and Microsoft Learn guidance.

### Reference-First Development

Before producing Dynamics 365 / Power Platform design, source changes, tests, or
deployment steps, load this file plus the relevant specialized guideline:

- Naming: `NamingConventions.md`
- Dataverse schema/data: `DataverseGuidelines.md`
- Model-driven apps/client script: `ModelDrivenAppGuidelines.md`
- Canvas apps: `CanvasAppGuidelines.md`
- Cloud flows: `PowerAutomateGuidelines.md`
- Plugins/custom APIs: `PluginCustomApiGuidelines.md`
- PCF: `PCFGuidelines.md`
- Security: `SecurityGuidelines.md`
- ALM/deployment/release: `ALMDeploymentGuidelines.md`, `release-pipeline.yml`

### Architecture Decision Process

- Same-table validations, calculated display behavior, and simple UI logic -> maker configuration, business rules, or model-driven form logic.
- Business process orchestration with connector actions and approvals -> Power Automate cloud flow.
- Transactional, low-latency Dataverse business logic -> synchronous plugin or custom API.
- Long-running or integration-heavy work -> asynchronous plugin, cloud flow, Azure Function, queue, or event-driven integration.
- Complex reusable UI control -> PCF component.
- CRUD-first user experience over Dataverse -> model-driven app.
- Task-specific mobile or composite UI -> canvas app.

### Core Standards

- All code, comments, and rule documentation must be written in English.
- Keep all first-party and custom components inside explicit solutions.
- Development uses unmanaged solutions; test, UAT, and production use managed solutions.
- Default solution customizations are forbidden except for inspection or emergency diagnosis.
- Use environment variables, connection references, configuration tables, and Azure Key Vault or secure platform features instead of hardcoded values.
- Prefer supported platform APIs and Microsoft-documented extension points.
- Keep solution layering simple and documented; avoid unmanaged customizations in downstream environments.
- Apply Power Platform Well-Architected pillars: reliability, security, operational excellence, performance efficiency, and experience optimization.

### Security, Identity, and Data Access

- Define least-privilege security roles and teams for every persona.
- Verify table privileges, column security, business units, sharing, and hierarchy impact.
- Do not store secrets in flows, apps, plugins, JavaScript, environment variables of type text, or source control.
- Use service principals or workload identity federation for CI/CD where available.
- Enforce DLP policies and connector governance before production release.
- Avoid logging personal, sensitive, credential, token, or regulated data.

### Performance and Service Protection

- Query only required Dataverse columns.
- Avoid retrieving all columns or using broad unfiltered queries.
- Respect Dataverse service protection limits and design for retry/backoff in external clients.
- Avoid synchronous long-running work in plugins, flows, and client scripts.
- Test with realistic data volumes, security roles, and concurrent usage where risk is meaningful.

### Testing and Quality

- Solution Checker must run for changed unmanaged solutions before deployment evidence is accepted.
- Critical and high Solution Checker findings are blocking unless a documented exception is approved.
- Plugin/custom API code must build and pass automated tests when present.
- PCF code must pass npm build/lint/test when present.
- Cloud flows must have run evidence or documented manual test evidence for changed business paths.
- Security role behavior must be verified for affected personas.

## Context Loading (Mandatory - Before Any Task)

Before starting any Dynamics 365 / Power Platform task:

1. Load `rules.md` (this file).
2. Load `NamingConventions.md`.
3. Load the phase-specific files listed below.

No design, source change, test, deployment, or release step may be produced
without this baseline.

## Recommended Project Structure

```text
solutions/
  [SolutionName]/
    src/                         # unpacked solution source
    [SolutionName]_managed.zip    # generated artifact only, not edited by hand
    [SolutionName].zip            # unmanaged export artifact only
plugins/
  [PluginProject]/
pcf/
  [ControlName]/
work-item/
  [project-slug]/
    05-build/
      build-log.md
      solution-inventory.md
      checker-results/
```

Project-specific repositories may use different folder names, but every
solution source path, plugin project, PCF project, and generated zip must be
documented in the work item build log.

---

## General Prohibitions

- Never customize the default solution for planned work.
- Never deploy unmanaged solutions to test, UAT, or production.
- Never hardcode environment URLs, GUIDs, credentials, tenant IDs, client secrets, queue names, or connector-specific values.
- Never commit solution export secrets, connection credentials, `.authprofile`, or local `pac` auth files.
- Never ignore critical or high Solution Checker issues without approved documented risk acceptance.
- Never leave unmanaged layers in downstream environments after release unless explicitly approved and recorded.
- Never use deprecated or unsupported Client API, OData v2.0, or direct DOM manipulation in model-driven apps.
- Never register synchronous plugins for long-running work or broad `Retrieve` / `RetrieveMultiple` logic without documented justification.
- Never use "all columns" retrieval patterns in plugins, integrations, or custom code.
- Never skip fault handling in cloud flows that perform writes, approvals, integrations, or notifications.
- Never release a flow, app, plugin, or PCF component without persona-based security validation when data access is affected.

## Phase 01 - Proposal

Record high-level impact only:

- Target Dynamics 365 app or Power Platform workload.
- Expected Dataverse data model impact.
- Licensing and connector implications.
- Security persona impact.
- ALM/release complexity.
- Integration and data migration risk.
- Environment strategy assumptions.

Do not include detailed schema, plugin, flow, or UI design in Phase 1.

---

## Phase 02 - Specs

Specs must include:

- User personas and affected security roles.
- Data ownership and access expectations.
- Solution boundary and component types in scope.
- Non-functional requirements: performance, availability, auditability, compliance, and monitoring.
- Environment variables, connection references, and external dependencies.
- Acceptance criteria for apps, flows, plugins, PCF, and security where relevant.

---

## Phase 03 - Design

Design must define:

- Solution structure and publisher.
- Dataverse schema changes and relationship impact.
- App UX model: model-driven, canvas, or both.
- Automation approach: cloud flow, plugin, custom API, or external service.
- Security model: roles, teams, field security, sharing, business units.
- ALM strategy: unmanaged source solution, managed artifact, pipeline environments, rollback plan.
- Test strategy and evidence required per component type.

---

## Phase 04 - Tasks

Tasks must be decomposed by deployable or verifiable unit:

- Dataverse schema group.
- Model-driven app/form/view command group.
- Canvas app change.
- Flow change.
- Plugin/custom API assembly and registration.
- PCF component.
- Security role or persona validation group.
- ALM pipeline/configuration change.

Each task must identify the target solution and expected evidence.

---

## Phase 05 - Construction

Applicable quality gates: DPPG5.1 through DPPG5.10.

### Mandatory Pre-Step

Before any build or deploy work begins:

1. Ensure `work-item/[project-slug]/05-build/` exists.
2. Create or update `work-item/[project-slug]/05-build/solution-inventory.md`.
3. Create or update `work-item/[project-slug]/05-build/build-log.md`.
4. Confirm the target unmanaged development solution name and source folder.

### Standard Build Loop

For each task:

1. Build or configure the component in the development environment.
2. Add the component to the explicit unmanaged solution.
3. Export the unmanaged solution.
4. Unpack it into source control with `pac solution unpack`.
5. Update `solution-inventory.md` with exact components changed.
6. Run Solution Checker before accepting deployment evidence.
7. Build managed solution artifact for downstream environments.
8. Import to the next non-production environment when required by the phase.
9. Record commands, versions, results, checker output, import result, and remediation notes in `build-log.md`.

### Required Commands

Use exact commands from `tech-config.yml` unless the project README overrides
environment names, solution paths, or authentication.

### Phase 5 Completion Checklist

- [ ] All changed components are in an explicit unmanaged solution.
- [ ] Default solution was not used for planned customization.
- [ ] `solution-inventory.md` lists every changed component.
- [ ] Unmanaged solution was exported and unpacked into source control.
- [ ] Managed solution artifact was generated for downstream import.
- [ ] Solution Checker executed with no critical/high findings, or approved exceptions recorded.
- [ ] Plugin/custom API code builds and tests pass when present.
- [ ] PCF code builds and tests pass when present.
- [ ] Cloud flow fault handling and run evidence are documented when flows changed.
- [ ] Security role/persona impact is documented.
- [ ] `build-log.md` contains commands, environment names, solution version, checker output, and import result.

---

## Phase 06 - Verification

Applicable quality gates: DPPG6.1 through DPPG6.6.

Verification compares implementation against design and task list using
Dynamics/Power Platform-specific gates.

### Static Analysis

- Solution Checker: mandatory for changed unmanaged solutions.
- Plugin/custom API projects: run `.NET` build and tests when present.
- PCF projects: run npm build/lint/test when present.
- JavaScript web resources: run project-defined linting and Solution Checker.

Any critical/high Solution Checker issue, failing build, failing test, or
missing execution evidence is a blocker.

### Artifact

```text
work-item/[project-slug]/06-verification/verification-report.md
```

---

## Phase 07 - Testing

Applicable quality gates: DPPG7.1 through DPPG7.5.

Testing must cover:

- App happy path, negative path, and role-restricted path.
- Flow trigger, success path, failure path, retry/timeout behavior, and run history evidence.
- Plugin/custom API positive, negative, depth/recursion, permissions, and bulk scenarios.
- PCF render, input/output contract, accessibility, and packaging behavior.
- Persona-based access for changed tables, columns, apps, flows, and commands.

### Artifact

```text
work-item/[project-slug]/07-testing/test-report.md
```

---

## Phase 08 - Commit and PR

PRs must include:

- Changed solution source folder and solution version.
- Build log and Solution Checker evidence.
- Test report or explicit test evidence links.
- Security role/persona validation summary.
- Confirmation that generated artifacts are tracked or ignored according to project policy.
- Confirmation that no secrets or local auth files are committed.

---

## Phase 09 - Release

Applicable quality gates: DPPG9.1 through DPPG9.5.

Release must follow `technology-rules/dynamics365-powerplatform/release-pipeline.yml`
unless the project provides an approved override.

Before production:

- Confirm managed solution artifact and version.
- Validate import in the target environment when supported by pipeline tooling.
- Confirm Solution Checker result and test evidence.
- Confirm DLP, connection references, environment variables, and service connections.
- Confirm release manager sign-off and rollback plan.
- Record import job/result and post-deployment smoke evidence.

### Rollback

Power Platform solution rollback depends on solution layering and component type.
The release plan must document one of:

- Import previous managed solution version.
- Apply managed solution upgrade rollback strategy.
- Restore environment backup when the change cannot be safely reversed by solution import.
- Disable affected flow/app/command as an emergency mitigation.

### Artifact

```text
work-item/[project-slug]/09-release/release-notes.md
```

---

## Phase 10 - Archive

Archive must preserve:

- Final solution version and managed artifact reference.
- Build log, checker results, import results, and test report.
- Environment names and pipeline hop.
- Security validation evidence.
- Rollback notes and known operational risks.
